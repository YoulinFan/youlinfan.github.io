I am currently pursuing my PhD at Xi'an University of Electronic Science and Technology, with a keen interest in artificial intelligence, game theory, and anti-jamming strategy. My current research focuses primarily on the theoretical and engineering applications of reinforcement learning, particularly in radar systems.
